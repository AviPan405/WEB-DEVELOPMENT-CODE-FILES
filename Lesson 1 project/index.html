        <p>Domestic cats (Felis catus) are small, carnivorous mammals, part of the Felidae family, and have been, for thousands of
        years, popular, independent, and intelligent human companions. Known for their agility, retractable claws, and
        exceptional night vision, they are crepuscular hunters (most active at dawn/dusk) that sleep 12 to 18 hours daily to
        conserve energy.
